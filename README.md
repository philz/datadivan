# Data Divan

Share a sqlite DB with only static hosting. Loads
the DB to the client, and runs SQL.js. Inspired by
[Datasette](https://datasette.io/), [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), 
[sql.js](https://sql.js.org/#/), and [sqlite-worker](https://github.com/WebReflection/sqlite-worker),
["SQLITE WITH WEBWORKERS"](https://observablehq.com/@a10k/sqlite-sql-js-with-webworkers).
